 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  In view of the malicious behavior of TaiChi framework (the modified
closed source commercial redistribution version of xposed framework),
we created the Anti Malware TaiChi Public License (AMTPL) to protect
the code rights related to anti TaiChi framework and applications that
donot want to be used by malicious framework TaiChi.
 
                ANTI MALWARE TAICHI PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 1 of the Anti Malware TaiChi Public
License (AMTPL).

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds
of works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the
work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making
of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of
the earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  "TaiChi" refers to the modified closed source commercial redistribution
version of xposed framework, developed by Shenzhen Dimen Space Network
Technology Co., Ltd.

  "Second License" means a supplement to this license. In case of conflict
between the second license and part of this license, the content of this
license shall prevail. No terms or conditions in this license apply to the
second license.

  1. Scope of application.
  
  This Agreement applies to any project that does not want the malicious
framework TaiChi to function properly. Including but not limited to
xposed modules, libraries, applications.

  2. Basic Permissions.
  
  This license reserves all rights by default (and does not grant any
rights), and only restricts the possible situations. In case of no
conflict with the terms and conditions of this license, the rights granted
by the second license shall prevail.

  Changing the license is not allowed, but you can change the second
license if it meets the requirements of the second license.

  3. Distributing Verbatim, Modified or Modified Source Copies or Versions.

  Any distribution (including but not limited to modify source code,
binary, decompilation or repackaging) is not allowed to delete or
change the code of detecting malicious framework TaiChi and the operation
after detecting malicious framework TaiChi.

  4. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  5. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
